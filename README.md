# Grain-Quality-Classification
# Introduction
Grain Quality Classification is a machine learning project aimed at classifying the quality of grains using various attributes such as texture, color, and size. The primary objective is to automate grain quality assessment, which is crucial for ensuring consistency in the agricultural industry.

This project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and leverages machine learning techniques for classification tasks. The notebook includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

# Features
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing raw data for analysis.
2. Feature Engineering: Extracting relevant features from the dataset.
3. Machine Learning Models: Implementation of multiple models to classify grain quality.
4. Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using various metrics.
5. Visualization: Visualizing data and model outcomes for better interpretation.
